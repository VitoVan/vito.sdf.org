# New Blog Address

November 2015

Hey, I switched my blog from [vitovan.com](http://vitovan.com) to [vito.sdf.org](http://vito.sdf.org).

**Why?**

1. No need to care about the server anymore.
2. sdf.org is much more solid, than my own server.
3. Shit I don't know why I did this, sorry guys.

**What's different?**

1. New RSS location: http://vito.sdf.org/rss.xml
2. I removed Twitter.
3. I removed some shameful articles.
4. I removed stupid pictures on the About page.
